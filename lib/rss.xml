Chapter 3 reproduces reflection and transmission amplitudes for electron scattering from arbitrary static external potentials, using the techniques of QED. In particular, this chapter does not address the phenomenon of tunnelling; instead, it introduces typical calculation techniques used in QFT/QED to treat external potentials. These techniques are later employed to describe tunnelling. This chapter restricts interactions with the potential to first and second order in the field coupling. For this reason, it is a perturbative scattering calculation.

In Chapter 4, the tunnelling regime is investigated by considering the all-order non-perturbative interactions with the barrier. Rather than investigate electron tunnelling, this chapter primarily focuses on neutral scalar fields for simplicity. These calculations are performed using QFT techniques; however, the underlying physics is still equivalent to RQM as no coupling to a mediator field is considered. I show that tunnelling probabilities for a single and double delta-function in position space can be reproduced analytically with these methods.

Chapter 5 considers an additional coupling between two neutral scalar fields, with the inclusion of a static external potential as before. The additional coupling introduces a QFT-type interaction, which introduces physics beyond RQM. I derive a non-perturbative integral equation which can describe the tunnelling of a neutral scalar field with QFT corrections.

The non-perturbative recursive equation derived in Chapter 5 cannot be solved analytically with conventional methods. Chapter 6 attempts to bound the solutions to the equation for the case of a delta potential. These bounds are derived by assuming decoupling of the mass and energy scales of the system.

<br>I conclude with a discussion about future numerical approaches to calculating QFT tun-<br>
nelling amplitudes, and how to extend the results of this thesis to more physically realisable systems.<br><br>Extending beyond:<br>

<br>however, for QFT loop corrections, it might be that the full Green’s function for a potential is required to adequately treat off-mass shell particles.


<br>
Quantising the external field:

The manifest breaking of Lorentz symmetry proved to be a significant hindrance to calculating loop amplitudes. One counterintuitive approach may be to forfeit the conceptual ease of an external potential, and instead promote it to a quantised field. The quantisation would preserve translational invariance, making subsequent amplitudes easier to calculate. However, the new field degrees of freedom would need to be integrated out at a later stage to describe tunnelling. This may be achieved with a Lorentz invariant effective field theory (EFT). In this case, the quantised field with unnecessary degrees of freedom can be described by the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations (derived from the fully quantised Lagrangian). These equations give a new expression for the quantised field in terms of other fields with relevant degrees of freedom, which can then be inserted into the original Lagrangian to obtain an EFT. In the context of nucleon-nucleon interactions, an example of this treatment of the photon field is presented in [94], which is shown to recover the Coulomb potential for an appropriate choice of gauge. However, the resulting Coulomb term is of course a non-local term in the Lagrangian. Usually the correspondence between a fully quantised field, the corresponding effective field, and an arbitrary potential, is initially unclear. Further investigation of these relationships is necessary in order to apply these ideas to general tunnelling problems.


<br>
Numerical approaches:

A common obstacle in this thesis was the lack of Lorentz invariance to exploit. This made results such as the vertex-corrected propagator in section 5.2.2, and even subsequent perturbative coupling simplifications (section 5.3 and chapter 6) difficult to probe analytically. As in high-energy collider physics, analytic methods for multi-loop integrals become increasingly intractable as the number of loops or mass scales increase [92]. This is particularly pertinent for divergent integrals, which need to be renormalised before any numerical investigation is performed. Even if there are no divergences (as in the case of the neutral scalar field propagator presented here), threshold singularities which occur when the propagators are on-shell make the application of Monte Carlo integration methods [95] non-trivial. While these integrals are formally finite, numerical integration methods will struggle to yield convergence [96]. This is true of both the frame-dependent integrals presented in this thesis, such as the dressed propagator in an external field in chapter 4, and one-loop corrections in chapters 5 and 6, and also for Lorentz invariant loop integrals generally. 


<br>
There has been significant progress in numerical computation of multi-loop Feynman integrals [97], including sector decomposition [98], numerical contour integration [99, 100], and integral reduction methods based on integration by parts [101] and Lorentz-invariance identities [102, 103].<br>
However, all public integration packages depend on specific properties of Lorentz-invariant forms and loop integrals, properties tunnelling amplitudes necessarily lack. The most promising numerical course of action for tunnelling is likely numerical contour integration, wherein the challenge lies with locating the poles of the integrand accurately and choosing an appropriate deformed contour to prevent numerical instability. However, this is a computationally demanding endeavour, equivalent to solving a convex optimisation problem  which becomes progressively more difficult as more phase-space points are considered (and Lorentz symmetry is still used to simplify some methods). While this may be an avenue to pursue, it is far beyond the scope of this project and significant work would be required to modify existing methods to suit tunnelling. I do not propose specific numerical integration schemes here because techniques for computing loop integrals or solving integral equations are intimately system-dependent.<br>
A more feasible pursuit may be investigating numerical methods in strong-field QED, where the external field is included by design. The advantage of these are that they already describe physical systems: typically orbital electrons and point Coulomb potentials. These works are confined to the Furry expansion in a Coulomb potential, where tunnelling effects are not explicitly considered. Typically, the numerical/analytical process is two-fold: first the RQM Green's function is determined, and then the remaining integrals in the Feynman amplitude are calculated. This is also the case with my work, as the RQM dressed propagator must be found before single-loop corrections can be calculated. In order to extend previous numerical work to tunnelling phenomena, the Green's function in the presence of a potential which has tunnelling solutions must be considered: this may be the Coulomb field with a strong constant (or rotating) external field, as in the case of tunnel ionization of atoms. Note that tunnel ionization may present additional difficulties; due to the bound nature of the electron, these states are not easily described within an -matrix formalism. This is a more general limitation of this thesis (but also QFT broadly): no bound states can be described with this work. However, the key idea regarding numerical methods in strong-field QED is the same: if RQM Green's functions can be found for physically useful potentials numerically, loop corrections may be added using the existing techniques in strong-field QED, enabling quantum corrections to tunnelling to be computed.
